# Jacinda COVID-19 Tweet sentiment analysis 


#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Objective
The New Zealand primeminister,Jacinda Adern has received a large amount of praise for the way she has handled COVID-19. After reading countless articles about her success and being a proud kiwi myself I wanted to see whether this sentiment was mirrored by the rest of the world. With data being the new oil and twitter being the voice of people I decided to use Twitter as a way to gauge the sentiment. The final objective is to see whether the press is mirroring the peoples real opinions. 


### Methods Used
* NLTK sentiment Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* GetOldTweets.py
* Pandas, jupyter


## Project Description
Although twitter has a RESTful API unfortunately it's only possible to crawl tweets for the week previous. So I decided to use GetoldTweets3, I found this great github with a py.file attached where you can request tweets by various different parameters. 

#### data sources
GetoldTweets3.py Parameters searchquery "jacinda covid-19" "jacinda corona" 01-02-2020 - 18-05-2020 

#### questions / hypothesis 

- Does the sentiment of tweets containing the words jacinda and covid-19 mirror the positive press and praise jacinda has received ? 

H0 : Overall people have a positive view of Jacindas response of COVID-19
h1 : Overall people do not have a positive view of Jacindas response of COVID-19


(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
